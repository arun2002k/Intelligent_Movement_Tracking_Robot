# Intelligent_Movement_Tracking_Robot

Different experiments were conducted and the performance of the robot was tested. Test was performed on the ultrasonic and infrared sensor. It was noted that the sensor was working accurately within a range of 4 meters. Then the test was performed  to check whether the robot maintains a specific distance with the target object. Then the serial communication between Arduino, motor shield and various motors was analysed. After the completion, It was observed that the results produced were very satisfying the robot was perfectly following the person wherever the person goes. Hence the objective of implementing the Intelligent Movement Tracking robot was achieved.
